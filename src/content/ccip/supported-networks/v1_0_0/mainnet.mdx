<Aside type="note" title="Early Access">
  <p>
    Chainlink CCIP is in the “Early Access” stage of development, which means that Chainlink CCIP currently has
    functionality which is under development and may be changed in later versions. There is no guarantee any of the
    contemplated features of Chainlink CCIP or the Chainlink Network will be implemented as specified. Chainlink CCIP is
    a messaging protocol. Chainlink does not hold or transfer any assets. Please review the{" "}
    <a href="https://chain.link/terms">Chainlink Terms of Service</a> which provides important information and
    disclosures. By using Chainlink CCIP, you expressly acknowledge and agree to accept these terms.

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice for CCIP v1.0.0 on Mainnet">
  CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on mainnet. You must use the new router addresses listed in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/mainnet) **before March 31st, 2024**. Please note that there is no
  change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0.0 mainnet routers will continue to function in parallel **until March
  31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2.0 routers as soon as possible. If you currently use CCIP
  v1.0.0, use the [@chainlink/contracts-ccip npm package version
  0.7.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/0.7.6). To migrate to v1.2.0, use [version 1.2.1 of
  the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/1.2.1) or later. Please refer to the
  [release notes](/ccip/release-notes) for a comprehensive overview of the enhancements and new features in v1.2.0.
