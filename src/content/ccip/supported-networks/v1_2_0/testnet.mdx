<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice for CCIP v1.0.0 on Testnet">
  CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on testnet. You must use the new router addresses listed in this page **before January
  31st, 2024**. Please note that there is no change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0.0 testnet routers will
  continue to function in parallel **until January 31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2.0 routers
  as soon as possible. If you currently use CCIP v1.0.0, use the [@chainlink/contracts-ccip npm package version
  0.7.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/0.7.6). To migrate to v1.2.0, use [version 1.2.1 of
  the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/1.2.1) or later. Please refer to the
  [release notes](/ccip/release-notes) for a comprehensive overview of the enhancements and new features in v1.2.0.

<Aside type="note" title="Testnet tokens">
  Read the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=ccip) page to learn where to get testnet LINK
  and native gas tokens. You can pay fees for each network in native gas tokens, wrapped native gas tokens, or LINK
  tokens.
