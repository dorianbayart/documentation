In the [Using Imports with Functions](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/importing-packages) tutorial, we explored the fundamentals of module imports. This tutorial will teach you how to use the Ethers library [encode](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/abi/abi-coder/#AbiCoder-encode) function to perform ABI encoding of several responses. Then, you will use the [ABI specifications](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/abi-spec.html) in Solidity to decode the responses in your smart contract.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have completed the [Using Imports with Functions](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/importing-packages) tutorial. Also,
check your subscription details (including the balance in LINK) in the [Chainlink Functions Subscription
Manager](https://functions.chain.link/). If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a
Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.

In this tutorial, you will use a different Chainlink Functions consumer contract, which shows how to use ABI decoding to decode the response received from Chainlink Functions:

1. [Open the FunctionsConsumerDecoder.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerDecoder.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerDecoder.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

1. Compile the contract.
1. Open MetaMask and select the _Polygon Mumbai_ network.
1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Polygon Mumbai_.
1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address for your specific blockchain. You can find this address on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page. For _Polygon Mumbai_, the router address is <CopyText text="0x6E2dc0F9DB014aE19888F539E59285D2Ea04244C" code/>.
1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Polygon Mumbai_.
1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy the contract address.
1. Add your consumer contract address to your subscription on _Polygon Mumbai_.

## Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates using the [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) library to interact with smart contract functions through a JSON RPC provider. It involves calling the [`latestRoundData`](/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata), [`decimals`](/data-feeds/api-reference#decimals), and [`description`](/data-feeds/api-reference#description) functions of a price feed contract based on the `AggregatorV3Interface`.
After retrieving the necessary data, the guide shows how to use ABI encoding to encode these responses into a single hexadecimal string and then convert this string to a [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array). This step ensures compliance with the [Chainlink functions' API requirements](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#data-encoding-functions), which specify that the source code must return a Uint8Array representing the bytes for on-chain use.

You can locate the scripts used in this tutorial in the [_examples/12-abi-encoding_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/12-abi-encoding).

To run the example:

1. Make sure you have correctly set up your environment first. If you haven't already, follow the [Set up your environment](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/importing-packages#set-up-your-environment) section of the [Using Imports with Functions](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/importing-packages) tutorial.
1. Open the file `request.js`, located in the [`12-abi-encoding`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/12-abi-encoding) folder.
1. Replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values.

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = "0x5fC6e53646CC53f0C3575fd2c71b5056c4823f5c" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
   const subscriptionId = 139 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
   ```

1. Make a request:

   ```shell
   node examples/12-abi-encoding/request.js
   ```

   The script runs your function in a sandbox environment before making an onchain transaction:

   ```text
   $ node examples/12-abi-encoding/request.js

   ```

   The output of the example gives you the following information:

   - Your request is first run on a sandbox environment to ensure it is correctly configured.
   - The fulfillment costs are estimated before making the request.
   - Your request was successfully sent to Chainlink Functions. The transaction in this example is `0x660bc9bd4c85645209295c957d0764823b94a1d351a5ead380113e5352e01fb5`, and the request ID is `0xa790aaaca3fdcdd0ca0b0e68bf0c699d84da8d59f8b6dd95aa3d4046a3801c27`.

   - The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.200304341399547731 LINK`.
   - The consumer contract received a response in hexadecimal string with a value of `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003e1b870b6320000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065c12153000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009425443202f205553440000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. This value is the ABI encoded response of the `latestRoundData`, `decimals`, and `description` of the _BTC / USD_ price feed. This value is then decoded and stored in the consumer contract.
   - The script calls the consumer contract to fetch the decoded values and then logs them to the console. The output is `Fetched BTC / USD price: 4267996919346 (updatedAt: 1707155795) (decimals: 8) (description: BTC / USD)`.

## Examine the code

### FunctionsConsumerDecoder.sol

<CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerDecoder.sol" />

This Solidity contract is similar to the [FunctionsConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumer.sol) contract used in the [Using Imports with Functions](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/importing-packages) tutorial. The main difference is the processing of the response in the `fulfillRequest` function:

- It uses Solidity `abi.decode` to decode the `response` to retrieve the `answer`, `updatedAt`, `decimals`, and `description`.

  ```solidity
  (
    uint256 answer,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint8 decimals,
    string memory description
  ) = abi.decode(response, (uint256, uint256, uint8, string));
  ```

- Then stores the decoded values in the contract state.

  ```solidity
  s_answer = answer;
  s_updatedAt = updatedAt;
  s_decimals = decimals;
  s_description = description;
  ```

### JavaScript example

#### source.js

The Decentralized Oracle Network will run the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/12-abi-encoding/source.js). The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

<ChainlinkFunctions section="deno-importe-notes" />

The example `source.js` file is similar to the one used in the [Using Imports with Functions](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/importing-packages#sourcejs) tutorial. It uses a JSON RPC call to the [`latestRoundData`](/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata), [`decimals`](/data-feeds/api-reference#decimals), and [`description`](/data-feeds/api-reference#description) functions of a [Chainlink Data Feed](/data-feeds). It then uses the `ethers` library to encode the response of these functions into a single hexadecimal string.

```javascript
const encoded = ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(
  ["uint256", "uint256", "uint8", "string"],
  [dataFeedResponse.answer, dataFeedResponse.updatedAt, decimals, description]
)
```

Finally, it uses the `ethers` library [`getBytes`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/utils/#getBytes) to convert the hexadecimal string to a `Uint8Array`:

```javascript
return ethers.getBytes(encoded)
```

#### request.js

This explanation focuses on the [request.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/12-abi-encoding/request.js) script and shows how to use the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) in your own JavaScript/TypeScript project to send requests to a DON. The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

The script imports:

- [path](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html) and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) : Used to read the [source file](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/12-abi-encoding/source.js).
- [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/): Ethers.js library, enables the script to interact with the blockchain.
- `@chainlink/functions-toolkit`: Chainlink Functions NPM package. All its utilities are documented in the [NPM README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit/blob/main/README.md).
- `@chainlink/env-enc`: A tool for loading and storing encrypted environment variables. Read the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to learn more.
- `../abi/functionsDecoder.json`: The abi of the contract your script will interact with. **Note**: The script was tested with this [FunctionsConsumerDecoder contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerDecoder.sol).

The script has two hardcoded values that you have to change using your own Functions consumer contract and subscription ID:

```javascript
const consumerAddress = "0x5fC6e53646CC53f0C3575fd2c71b5056c4823f5c" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
const subscriptionId = 139 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
```

The primary function that the script executes is `makeRequestMumbai`. This function consists of five main parts:

1. Definition of necessary identifiers:

   - `routerAddress`: Chainlink Functions router address on Polygon Mumbai.
   - `donId`: Identifier of the DON that will fulfill your requests on Polygon Mumbai.
   - `explorerUrl`: Block explorer url of Polygon Mumbai.
   - `source`: The source code must be a string object. That's why we use `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and then call `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
   - `args`: During the execution of your function, These arguments are passed to the source code.
   - `gasLimit`: Maximum gas that Chainlink Functions can use when transmitting the response to your contract.
   - Initialization of ethers `signer` and `provider` objects. The signer is used to make transactions on the blockchain, and the provider reads data from the blockchain.

1. Simulating your request in a local sandbox environment:

   - Use `simulateScript` from the Chainlink Functions NPM package.
   - Read the `response` of the simulation. If successful, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.bytes` in this example).

1. Estimating the costs:

   - Initialize a `SubscriptionManager` from the Functions NPM package, then call the `estimateFunctionsRequestCost`.
   - The response is returned in Juels (1 LINK = 10\*\*18 Juels). Use the `ethers.utils.formatEther` utility function to convert the output to LINK.

1. Making a Chainlink Functions request:

   - Initialize your functions consumer contract using the contract address, abi, and ethers signer.
   - Call the `sendRequest` function of your consumer contract.

1. Waiting for the response:

   - Initialize a `ResponseListener` from the Functions NPM package and then call the `listenForResponseFromTransaction` function to wait for a response. By default, this function waits for five minutes.
   - Upon reception of the response, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.bytes` in this example).

1. Read the decoded response:

   - Call the `s_answer`, `s_updatedAt`, `s_decimals`, and `s_description` functions of your consumer contract to fetch the decoded values.
   - Log the decoded values to the console.
