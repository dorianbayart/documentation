In this tutorial, you send a request to a Decentralized Oracle Network to call the [Cryptocompare GET /data/pricemultifull API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint). After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) completes offchain computation and aggregation, it returns several responses to your smart contract. The response includes an asset price, daily volume, and market name to your smart contract. The example uses query parameters to specify the ETH/USD asset pair, but you can configure HTTP query parameters to make requests for different assets.

<Aside type="note">
  Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You must ensure that the data sources or APIs specified in requests
  are of sufficient quality and have the proper availability for your use case. You are responsible for complying with
  the licensing agreements for all data providers that you connect with through Chainlink Functions. Violations of data
  provider licensing agreements or the [terms](https://chain.link/terms) can result in suspension or termination of your
  Chainlink Functions account.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Maximum response size">
  You can return any number of responses as long as they are encoded in a `bytes` response. The maximum response size
  that you can return is 256 bytes.

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the `ETH/USD`, daily volume, and market in a single request. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section.

You can locate the scripts used in this tutorial in the [_examples/3-custom-response_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/3-custom-response).

To run the example:

1. Open the file `request.js`, which is located in the `3-custom-response` folder.
1. Replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values.

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
   const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
   ```

1. Make a request:

   ```shell
   node examples/3-custom-response/request.js
   ```

   The script runs your function in a sandbox environment before making an onchain transaction:

   ```text
   $ node examples/3-custom-response/request.js

     fulfillmentCode: 0
   }

   ✅ Decoded response to string:  {"price":"1632.64","volume":"57673.36","lastMarket":"Bitstamp"}
   ```

   The output of the example gives you the following information:

   - Your request is first run on a sandbox environment to ensure it is correctly configured.
   - The fulfillment costs are estimated before making the request.
   - Your request was successfully sent to Chainlink Functions. The transaction in this example is [0x99b70944262ff2f0f8c4c98eaa9927c3519267522fd82d5442a5cfcc6cf913d4](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x99b70944262ff2f0f8c4c98eaa9927c3519267522fd82d5442a5cfcc6cf913d4) and the request ID is `0x121db06a58c4646ca9282520b6a526d83bf84831647bb2c7fc99e36cbd343aa4`.

   - The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.00003809801507364 LINK`.
   - The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x7b227072696365223a22313633322e3634222c22766f6c756d65223a2235373637332e3336222c226c6173744d61726b6574223a224269747374616d70227d`. Decoding it off-chain to `string` gives you a result:

     `{"price":"1632.64","volume":"57673.36","lastMarket":"Bitstamp"}`

## Examine the code

### FunctionsConsumerExample.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### JavaScript example

#### source.js

The Decentralized Oracle Network will run the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/3-custom-response/source.js). The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

<ChainlinkFunctions section="deno-importe-notes" />

This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) to make HTTP requests. To request the `ETH/USD` price, the source code calls the `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` URL. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) documentation, you see that you must provide the following parameters:

- `url`: `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull`
- `params`: The query parameters object:

  ```
  {
    fsyms: fromSymbol,
    tsyms: toSymbol
  }
  ```

To check the expected API response, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` or run the `curl` command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json
{
  "RAW": {
    "ETH": {
      "USD": {
        "TYPE": "5",
        "MARKET": "CCCAGG",
        "FROMSYMBOL": "ETH",
        "TOSYMBOL": "USD",
        "FLAGS": "2049",
        "PRICE": 2867.04,
        "LASTUPDATE": 1650896942,
        "MEDIAN": 2866.2,
        "LASTVOLUME": 0.16533939,
        "LASTVOLUMETO": 474.375243849,
        "LASTTRADEID": "1072154517",
        "VOLUMEDAY": 195241.78281014622,
        "VOLUMEDAYTO": 556240560.4621655,
        "VOLUME24HOUR": 236248.94641103,
        ...
}
```

The price is located at `RAW,ETH,USD,PRICE`, the volume is at `RAW,ETH,USD,VOLUME24HOUR`, and the market is at `RAW,ETH,USD,LASTMARKET`.

The main steps of the scripts are:

- Fetch `fromSymbol` and `toSymbol` from `args`.
- Construct the HTTP object `cryptoCompareRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`.
- Make the HTTP call.
- Read the asset price, daily volume, and market from the response.
- Construct a JSON object.

  ```javascript
  const result = {
    price: price.toFixed(2),
    volume: volume.toFixed(2),
    lastMarket,
  }
  ```

- Convert the JSON object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify(result)`. This step is mandatory before encoding `string` to `bytes`.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.string` helper function. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.

#### request.js

This explanation focuses on the [request.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/3-custom-response/request.js) script and shows how to use the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) in your own JavaScript/TypeScript project to send requests to a DON. The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

The script imports:

- [path](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html) and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) : Used to read the [source file](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/3-custom-response/source.js).
- [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/): Ethers.js library, enables the script to interact with the blockchain.
- `@chainlink/functions-toolkit`: Chainlink Functions NPM package. All its utilities are documented in the [NPM README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit/blob/main/README.md).
- `@chainlink/env-enc`: A tool for loading and storing encrypted environment variables. Read the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to learn more.
- `../abi/functionsClient.json`: The abi of the contract your script will interact with. **Note**: The script was tested with this [FunctionsConsumerExample contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol).

The script has two hardcoded values that you have to change using your own Functions consumer contract and subscription ID:

```javascript
const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
```

The primary function that the script executes is `makeRequestMumbai`. This function consists of five main parts:

1. Definition of necessary identifiers:

   - `routerAddress`: Chainlink Functions router address on Polygon Mumbai.
   - `donId`: Identifier of the DON that will fulfill your requests on Polygon Mumbai.
   - `explorerUrl`: Block explorer url of Polygon Mumbai.
   - `source`: The source code must be a string object. That's why we use `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and then call `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
   - `args`: During the execution of your function, These arguments are passed to the source code. The `args` value is `["ETH", "USD"]`, which fetches the current `ETH/USD` price. You can adapt `args` to fetch another asset price. See the [CryptoCompare API docs](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint) to get the list of supported symbols.
   - `gasLimit`: Maximum gas that Chainlink Functions can use when transmitting the response to your contract.
   - Initialization of ethers `signer` and `provider` objects. The signer is used to make transactions on the blockchain, and the provider reads data from the blockchain.

1. Simulating your request in a local sandbox environment:

   - Use `simulateScript` from the Chainlink Functions NPM package.
   - Read the `response` of the simulation. If successful, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.string` in this example).

1. Estimating the costs:

   - Initialize a `SubscriptionManager` from the Functions NPM package, then call the `estimateFunctionsRequestCost`.
   - The response is returned in Juels (1 LINK = 10\*\*18 Juels). Use the `ethers.utils.formatEther` utility function to convert the output to LINK.

1. Making a Chainlink Functions request:

   - Initialize your functions consumer contract using the contract address, abi, and ethers signer.
   - Call the `sendRequest` function of your consumer contract.

1. Waiting for the response:

   - Initialize a `ResponseListener` from the Functions NPM package and then call the `listenForResponseFromTransaction` function to wait for a response. By default, this function waits for five minutes.
   - Upon reception of the response, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.string` in this example).
