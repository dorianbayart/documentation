The configurations detailed on this page refer to [token pools](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) and [CCIP rate limits](/ccip/architecture#ccip-rate-limits). Each supported token has a [token pool](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) to facilitate various operations for transferring token value, and to enable [rate limits](/ccip/architecture#ccip-rate-limits) on token transfers. There are [rate limits for each individual token pool](/ccip/architecture#token-pool-rate-limit) and also [aggregate rate limits](/ccip/architecture#aggregate-rate-limit) that apply to all supported tokens on a particular lane. Both types of rate limits have a maximum capacity and a refill rate.

This page also lists the supported fee tokens for each lane, which shows how you can pay for CCIP fees. The [CCIP Billing](/ccip/billing) page explains how CCIP fees are calculated.
