This guide shows you how to read data from a Data Stream, validate the answer, and store the answer onchain. This example uses a [Chainlink Automation Log Trigger](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to check for events that require data. For this example, the log trigger comes from a simple emitter contract. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Engine, return the data in a callback, and run the [`performUpkeep` function](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#performupkeep-function-for-log-triggers) on your registered upkeep contract. The `performUpkeep` function calls the `verify` function on the verifier contract.

## Before you begin

- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract) so you are familiar with the tools that are necessary for this guide:
  - The [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language
  - The [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) wallet
  - The [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) development environment
- Acquire testnet funds. This guide requires testnet ETH and LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_.
  - Use the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) to transfer testnet ETH from Ethereum Sepolia to Arbitrum Sepolia. Testnet ETH on Ethereum Sepolia is available at one of [several faucets](https://faucetlink.to/sepolia).
  - Testnet LINK is available for Arbitrum Sepolia at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
- Learn how to [Fund your contract with LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract).

## Deploy the Chainlink Automation upkeep contract

Deploy an upkeep contract that is enabled to retrieve data from Data Streams. For this example, you will read from the ETH/USD stream with ID `0x00027bbaff688c906a3e20a34fe951715d1018d262a5b66e38eda027a674cd1b` on Arbitrum Sepolia. See the [Stream Identifiers](/data-streams/stream-ids) page for a complete list of available assets, IDs, and verifier proxy addresses.

1. [Open the StreamsUpkeep.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeep.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeep.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Select the `0.8.16` Solidity compiler and the `StreamsUpkeep.sol` contract in the **Solidity Compiler** tab.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/solidity-compiler.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Solidity Compiler"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Compile the contract. You can ignore the warning messages for this example.

1. Open MetaMask and set the network to _Arbitrum Sepolia_. If you need to add Arbitrum Sepolia to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="421614_0xb1D4538B4571d411F07960EF2838Ce337FE1E80E"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet"
     >
       Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/injected-provider.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Injected Provider MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. In the **Contract** section, select the `StreamsUpkeep` contract and fill in the **verifier proxy address** corresponding to the stream you want to read from. You can find this address on the [Stream IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page. The verifier proxy address for the ETH/USD stream on Arbitrum Sepolia is <CopyText text="0x2ff010DEbC1297f19579B4246cad07bd24F2488A" code/>.

     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Deploy Upkeep Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to ensure you deploy the contract to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Save this contract address for later.

     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Deployed Upkeep Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

## Deploy the emitter contract

This contract emits logs that trigger the upkeep. This code can be part of your dApp. For example, you might emit log triggers when your users initiate a trade or other action requiring data retrieval. For this Getting Started guide, use a very simple emitter so you can test the upkeep and data retrieval.

1. [Open the LogEmitter.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataStreams/LogEmitter.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/LogEmitter.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Under the **Solidity Compiler** tab, select the `0.8.19` Solidity compiler and click the **Compile LogEmitter.sol** button to compile the contract.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/compile-logemitter.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Compile Log Emitter Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Open MetaMask and make sure the network is still set to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, ensure the **Environment** is still set to _Injected Provider - MetaMask_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/injected-provider.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Injected Provider MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to ensure you deploy the contract to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/deploy-logemitter.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Deploy Emitter Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Save this contract address for later.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/deployed-logemitter.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Deployed Emitter Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

## Register the upkeep

Register a new **Log trigger** upkeep. See [Automation Log Triggers](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to learn more about how to register Log Trigger upkeeps.

1. Go to the [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) for _Arbitrum Sepolia_ and connect your browser wallet.

1. Click **Register new Upkeep**.

1. Select the **Log trigger** upkeep type and click **Next**.

1. Specify the upkeep contract address you saved earlier as the **Contract to automate**. In this example, you can ignore the warning about the Automation compatible contract verification. Click **Next**.

1. Specify the emitter contract address that you saved earlier. This tells Chainlink Automation what contracts to watch for log triggers. Then click **Next**.

1. Provide the ABI if the contract is not validated. To find the ABI of your contract in Remix, navigate to the **Solidity Compiler** tab. Then, copy the ABI to your clipboard using the button at the bottom of the panel.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/remix-copy-abi.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Log Emitter ABI"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Select the `Log` event as the triggering event in the **Emitted log** dropdown. **Log index topic filters** are optional filters to narrow the logs you want to trigger your upkeep. For this example, leave the field blank. Click **Next**.

1. Specify a name for the upkeep.

1. Specify a **Starting balance** of 1 testnet LINK for this example. You can retrieve unused LINK later.

1. Leave the **Check data** value and other fields blank for now, and click **Register Upkeep**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Wait for the transaction to complete.

## Fund the upkeep contract

In this example, the upkeep contract pays for onchain verification of reports from Data Streams. The Automation subscription does not cover the cost.

Open MetaMask and send 1 testnet LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_ to the upkeep contract address you saved earlier.

    <ClickToZoom
      src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/fund-deployed-upkeep.webp"
      alt="Chainlink Data Streams Fund Deployed Upkeep"
      style="max-width: 70%;"
    />

## Emit a log

Now, you can use your emitter contract to emit a log and initiate the upkeep, which retrieves data for the specified Data Streams asset ID.

1. In Remix, on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your emitter contract under the **Deployed Contracts** section.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/emitter-emitlog.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Emit Log"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the `emitLog` button to call the function and emit a log. MetaMask prompts you to accept the transaction.

After the transaction is complete, the log is emitted, and the upkeep is triggered. You can find the upkeep transaction hash in the [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia). Check to make sure the transaction is successful.

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/request-fulfilled.webp" />

## View the retrieved price

The retrieved price is stored as a variable in the contract and emitted in the logs.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the details of your upkeep contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1. Click the `last_retrieved_price` getter function to view the retrieved price. The answer on the ETH/USD feed uses 18 decimal places, so an answer of `248412100000000000` indicates an ETH/USD price of 2484.121. Each feed uses a different number of decimal places for answers. See the [Stream IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page for more information.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/deployed-upkeep-2.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Deployed Upkeep"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

Alternatively, you can view the price emitted in the logs for your upkeep transaction. You can find the upkeep transaction hash at [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) and view the transaction logs in the [Arbitrum Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/).

## Examine the code

The example code you deployed has all the interfaces and functions required to work with Chainlink Automation as an upkeep contract. It follows a similar flow to the trading flow in the [Architecture](/data-streams#example-trading-flow) documentation but uses a basic log emitter to simulate the client contract that would initiate a `StreamsLookup`. After the contract receives and verifies the report, `performUpkeep` stores the price from the report in the `last_retrieved_price` and emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the price. You could modify this to use the data in a way that works for your specific use case and application.

The code example uses `revert` with `StreamsLookup` to convey call information about what streams to retrieve. See the [EIP-3668 rationale](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668#rationale) for more information about how to use `revert` in this way.
